# Debugging and Improvement Workflow

## Status: Starting Debugging Phase

### Commit Log
1. ✅ Initial commit with provided codebase

### Next Steps
1. Review all Python files for obvious bugs
2. Try running the pipeline to identify errors
3. Fix bugs incrementally with commits
4. Improve model performance
5. Document findings

### Files to Review
- [ ] src/data/make_dataset.py - Data loading and cleaning
- [ ] src/features/build_features.py - Feature engineering
- [ ] src/features/transformations.py - Feature transformations
- [ ] src/models/train_model.py - Model training
- [ ] src/models/predict_model.py - Predictions
- [ ] src/models/classifier.py - Model definition
- [ ] src/utils/*.py - Utility functions
- [ ] test/*.py - Unit tests

### Bugs Found
